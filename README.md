## Hello there 👋
![alt text](Gabby.png)

My name is **Gabrielle (Gabby) Ritchie**   and I was born and raised in the *Bahamas* 🌞🐚🌴.
### Pronouns 
She/Her

### What am I studying? 🤔📓🎓
I am currently in my **third year** of a **Bachelor of Science major in Psychology** at *Dalhousie University*. 
### Why Did I Choose To Take The Course Neural Data Science? 
I enrolled in this class because I was interested in learning the data science used for the brain, specifically in relation to EEGs and other neural scans. As well as that, I am **not** experienced in coding in the slightest and it always seemed overwhelming  to me so I also chose this course as it would be a nice *challenge* as it's something outside of my comfort zone. 
### Why Psychology? 
I decided to pursue a degree in psychology as the subject always interested me, especially the psychopathology aspect of it, and I would like to add to the small number of psychologists in the Bahamas and help advocate for and help those with mental illnesses.  
### My Future Plans ⌛
- Complete a Masters Degree in Clinical Psychology
- Complete a PhD in Clinical Psychology
